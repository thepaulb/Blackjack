Ok, final step, can we refactor the following class which forms the card deck in the Blackjack game. 

As a senior JS developer refactor these 2 classes to:
1. improve readability.
2. Group methods together based on type; DOM manipulation, public API, game logic, etc

Provide the refactored code with comments explaining the changes.

NEXT, can you refactor the class to align with best practices and modern standards.

Again, provide the refactored code with comments explaining the changes.
